# Business Requirements - Invoice Processing Automation

## Business Objectives

The primary objective is to **reduce invoice processing time by 60%** and improve accuracy to 99%. Currently, our AP team processes invoices manually, taking an average of 5 days from receipt to payment approval. This causes:
- Missed early payment discounts (2% for payment within 10 days)
- Strained vendor relationships due to late payments
- High operational costs ($15 per invoice processed)

Strategic alignment: This initiative supports our digital transformation roadmap and operational excellence goals for FY2025.

## Stakeholder Landscape

**Executive Sponsor**: CFO - Sarah Chen
- Strong commitment to automation
- Allocated budget for transformation
- Quarterly steering committee meetings

**Key Stakeholders**:
- AP Manager (Jane Smith) - 15-person team, concerned about job security
- Procurement Director (Mike Johnson) - Wants better vendor visibility
- IT Director (Tom Wilson) - Concerned about integration complexity
- Compliance Officer (Lisa Brown) - Focused on audit trail requirements

## Organizational Culture

Our organization has a **moderate appetite for innovation**. We successfully implemented Workday HCM 2 years ago, which gives us confidence in large-scale system changes. However, there is some resistance from the AP team who fear automation will eliminate jobs.

Decision-making typically takes 4-6 weeks through our governance committees. We have a collaborative culture with cross-functional teams, though some silos exist between Finance and IT.

## User Adoption

**Primary Users**: 15 AP clerks (ages 35-55, moderate tech proficiency)
- Currently comfortable with Excel and email
- Limited experience with AI/automation tools
- Concerned about learning new systems

**Attitudes toward AI**: Mixed - younger staff are enthusiastic, senior staff are skeptical. Previous automation project (expense management) had poor adoption due to lack of training.

## Process Maturity

Current invoice processing is **partially documented** with standard operating procedures (SOPs) for common scenarios. However, exception handling is largely tribal knowledge. Process complexity is high due to:
- 200+ vendor-specific rules
- Multiple approval workflows based on amount thresholds
- Frequent exceptions requiring manual intervention (30% of invoices)

We have a continuous improvement team that meets monthly, but process optimization is reactive rather than proactive.

## Success Metrics

**KPIs Defined**:
- Invoice processing time: Reduce from 5 days to 2 days
- Processing cost: Reduce from $15 to $5 per invoice
- Accuracy rate: Improve from 94% to 99%
- Vendor satisfaction: Increase from 72% to 85%

**Current Baselines**: Measured quarterly through manual sampling (500 invoices per quarter)
