Technical Feasibility Assessment Guidelines

Weight: 30%
Description: Evaluates the technical readiness and capability to implement agentic AI solutions

Assessment Categories

1. Current Architecture & Systems

Points to Extract:
- Existing system architecture (monolithic, microservices, serverless)

- Cloud maturity level (on-premise, hybrid, cloud-native)
- System integration patterns currently employed
- API landscape and API management approach

Sample Questions:
- Can you describe your current system architecture?
- What cloud platforms are you currently using, if any?
- How do your systems currently communicate with each other?
- Do you have an API gateway or API management solution in place?

2. Integration Landscape

Points to Extract:

- Critical SLAs and performance requirements

Sample Questions:
- How many systems would need to integrate with the agentic AI solution?
- Do you currently use event-driven patterns or message queues?
- What are your latency and throughput requirements?
- Are there any critical SLAs we need to be aware of?

3. Data Strategy & Readiness

Points to Extract:
- Data sources and their locations
- Data quality and governance maturity
- Data classification and sensitivity levels (PII, PHI, PCI)
- Data residency and sovereignty requirements
- Existing data lakes, warehouses, or knowledge bases
- Vector database or semantic search capabilities

Sample Questions:
- Where does your critical business data currently reside?
- How would you rate your data quality and governance practices?
- Do you handle sensitive data that requires special compliance?
- Do you have any existing knowledge bases or document repositories?
- Have you worked with vector databases or semantic search before?

4. Security & Identity

Points to Extract:
- Identity and access management approach
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Encryption standards (at rest, in transit, in use)
- Network security posture (VPCs, firewalls, segmentation)
- Security monitoring and incident response capabilities
- Secrets management approach

Sample Questions:
- What identity provider do you use for authentication?
- How do you currently manage application secrets and credentials?
- What encryption standards are you required to meet?
- Do you have network segmentation or VPC isolation in place?
- How do you monitor for security threats and incidents?

5. Observability & Operations

Points to Extract:
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Distributed tracing capabilities
- Alerting and incident management processes
- Performance monitoring and APM tools
- Operational runbooks and automation level

Sample Questions:
- What logging and monitoring tools do you currently use?
- Do you have distributed tracing implemented?
- How do you currently handle alerts and incidents?
- What level of operational automation do you have?

6. Model & AI Infrastructure

Points to Extract:
- Current AI/ML capabilities and experience
- Foundation models in use or evaluated
- Model deployment and serving infrastructure
- MLOps maturity and practices
- Model governance and versioning approach
- Prompt engineering and management capabilities

Sample Questions:
- Have you deployed AI/ML models in production before?
- Which foundation models have you evaluated or used?
- How do you currently manage model versions and deployments?
- Do you have prompt engineering expertise in your team?
- What's your approach to model monitoring and drift detection?

7. Scalability & Performance

Points to Extract:
- Expected transaction volumes and growth projections
- Peak load patterns and seasonality
- Auto-scaling capabilities and experience
- Performance benchmarks and targets
- Disaster recovery and business continuity requirements

Sample Questions:
- What transaction volumes do you expect to handle?
- Do you experience seasonal peaks or variable load patterns?
- What are your performance targets (latency, throughput)?
- What are your disaster recovery and uptime requirements?

8. Development & Deployment

Points to Extract:
- CI/CD pipeline maturity
- Infrastructure as Code adoption (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Testing practices (unit, integration, E2E)
- Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)
- Environment management (dev, staging, prod)
- Version control and branching strategies

Sample Questions:
- Do you have CI/CD pipelines in place?
- Are you using Infrastructure as Code?
- What testing practices do you follow?
- How do you manage deployments across environments?
- What version control system and branching strategy do you use?

Scoring Guidance

High Readiness: Cloud-native architecture, strong API/event-driven patterns, mature data governance, comprehensive security, MLOps experience

Medium Readiness: Hybrid architecture, some integration capabilities, basic data governance, standard security practices, limited AI experience

Low Readiness: Legacy monolithic systems, limited integration, poor data quality, basic security, no AI/ML experience
